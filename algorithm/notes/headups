Create the Project
Unity 3D, URP if need want some lighting juice. Name it something fire like Carks or Rot City.

Player Setup
Drop in a player model or a placeholder. Add a CharacterController or Rigidbody if you’re going physics-based. Set up movement script with Input.GetAxis() for WASD or joystick. Smooth inputs only—don’t make it stiff.

Camera Follow
Use Cinemachine drag it in, set Follow/LookAt to the player. Done. Feels clean.

Idle/Walk Animations
Animator time.

Set up parameters: Speed, maybe IsRunning.

Idle when Speed == 0, Walk when > 0.

Blend tree if need smoother
 don’t forget to actually plug the Animator into the movement script.

Weapon Setup

Gun model in player’s hand (child of hand bone or just position it right).

Shooting script: Raycast from camera forward or spawn bullets with rigidbody + velocity.

Add muzzle flash and sound (spawn particle prefab, play gunshot sound).

Anim: recoil, reload.

Bullet impact? Instantiate blood, sparks, whatever fits.

Zombie Model & Idle/Walk Anim
Drop in zombie model, attach Animator.
Set up Idle/Walk/Attack animations in Animator Controller.
Add blend tree if you're doing smooth transitions.
Keep it janky if that’s your vibe.

Zombie AI Movement
Use NavMesh:

Bake the map

Add NavMeshAgent to zombie

Script it to set agent.destination = player.transform.position

Switch to attack animation when close enough

LookAt player or rotate with Quaternion.LookRotation()
Optional: Add some random idle wandering if not chasing.

Zombie Attack Logic

Set up trigger or distance check

On contact: reduce player health

Add attack delay so it’s not spammy

Play hit animation & sound

Player Damage System

Add health script

Show health bar (UI slider or just a red overlay)

Death animation or ragdoll on 0 HP

Trigger Game Over screen n Zombie Health & Death

Zombies take damage on hit

Show blood particle or animation

Destroy or ragdoll on 0 HP

Maybe drop something (ammo, health)

Animations Matter
Don’t be lazyyyyyyyyy

Reload anim

Gun recoil

Player damage flash

Zombie stumbles or flinches when shot
These little things = JUICE.

Zombie Spawner

Empty GameObjects = spawn points

Script spawns zombies at random points over time

Add wave system or infinite spawn with difficulty ramp

UI Setup

Health bar

Ammo count

Zombie kill count

Crosshair

Wave number
Clean, no clutter. Keep it visible.

Sound Design

Gunshots

Zombie groan 
Footsteps

Ambient horror track
Sound makes your game feel 5x better. Trust me.

Reload Mechanic

Track ammo

R to reload

Wait for reload anim to finish before allowing fire

Dry fire sound when you’re out? Always a nice touch

Build a Map

Layout matters: choke points, open areas, corners to get trapped in

Drop in props: cars, barrels, fences

Add lighting—baked or realtime for atmosphere

Use fog
End Conditions

Player dies = Game Over

Survive X waves = Victory

Or go full arcade = endless, high score, leaderboard

Polish & Juice

Screen shake on shots

Flash when hit

Blood decals

Anim transitions smooth

Particles for everything
This is what makes it feel good.
