Last1Out :

Last1Out is a zombie survival shooter built in Unity. The world has already collapsed, and you play as the final survivor trapped inside the ruins of civilization. There is no extraction team on the way and no shelter left standing. Your only options are to move, fight, and hold out for as long as you can while the infected swarm the streets.

The game focuses on fluid character movement, responsive gunplay, and continuous pressure from increasingly aggressive waves of enemies. There are no breaks between waves; the challenge is constant. Your survival time becomes your score, and the game is built around pushing you to improve with every run.

Core Gameplay
Player Movement

Movement is designed to be smooth and unrestricted. The player can sprint, dodge, weave through obstacles, and maneuver quickly between choke points. The intention is to give you enough mobility to stay alive even as enemies close in from every direction.

Weapons

Weapons are built to feel powerful and mechanical, with distinct recoil patterns, reload animations, and audio cues. Early-game firearms are intentionally modest, but as you progress, you unlock stronger options with faster fire rates, higher damage output, and unique characteristics. Ammo is limited, requiring careful decision-making during high-pressure moments.

Enemies

Zombies spawn in waves that increase in both volume and difficulty. Each wave reduces your breathing room, forcing you to constantly reposition. Different types of infected are planned, including fast sprinters, tank-like brutes, and late-game variants that require specific tactics to counter.

Scoring and Progression

Your survival time, kill count, and wave reached contribute to your score. Higher scores unlock new weapons, upgrades, cosmetics, and potential modifiers for future runs. The longer you stay alive, the more the game rewards you, though the difficulty rises proportionally.
